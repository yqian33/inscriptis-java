comment-comment : How did you end up reading the passed parameters in the triggered DAG? I need to do the same, and while I can confirm the parameter I want to pass is part of the dag run object's payload, I can't seem to "read" it in the triggered DAG.
comment-date : Jun 19 '18 at 19:51
code : "{{ dag_run.conf['message'] }}"
code : "{{ dag_run.conf['day'] }}"
code : "{{ dag_run.conf['day'] }}"
comment-comment : I could access the parameters in my triggered dag with "{{ dag_run.conf['message'] }}" and "{{ dag_run.conf['day'] }}" . This relies on the fields in the operator through which you are trying to read the parameters being template_fields. If the "{{ dag_run.conf['day'] }}" pattern doesn't work for you because the fields aren't template_fields, you will be able to extend the operator class which you are using to make those fields template_fields. Let me know if this doesn't make sense and I will include it in my answer.

comment-comment : * Hmmm.. I generate a file in the first DAG, and then read the file and dynamically generate tasks based on the data in the file, in the triggered DAG. Currently, I have no good way of "sending" the filename to the DAG. I can make it part of the payload, but can't assign it to a variable in the triggered DAG. I had already tried the methods in the examples and the ones you've used too.
comment-date : Jun 20 '18 at 18:06
comment-comment : * I programatically create the filename in the first DAG and then use the same logic in the triggered DAG to read it. It is dangerous and error-prone and all that, but till I can figure out a way to pass the filename to the triggered DAG, I have no option, it seems.

comment-date : Jun 11 '21 at 11:41
comment-comment : * @mathee, Yes, it appears that you can't do that using TriggerDagRunOperator. I solved that by adding an extra PythonOperator right before I called the TriggerDagRunOperator and I set up the dag_run_obj there
