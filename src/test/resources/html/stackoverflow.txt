          Providing context in TriggerDagRunOperator

                  I have a dag that has been triggered by another dag. I have passed through to this dag some configuration variables via the DagRunOrder().payload dictionary in the same way the official example has done.

                  Now in this dag I have another TriggerDagRunOperator to start a second dag and would like to pass those same configuration variables through.

                  I have succesfully accessed the payload variables in a PythonOperator like so:

                  def run_this_func(ds, **kwargs):
                      print("Remotely received value of {} for message and {} for day".format(
                          kwargs["dag_run"].conf["message"], kwargs["dag_run"].conf["day"])
                      )

                  run_this = PythonOperator(
                      task_id='run_this',
                      provide_context=True,
                      python_callable=run_this_func,
                      dag=dag
                  )


                  But the same pattern does not work in the TriggerDagRunOperator:

                  def trigger(context, dag_run_obj, **kwargs):
                      dag_run_obj.payload = {
                          "message": kwargs["dag_run"].conf["message"],
                          "day": kwargs["dag_run"].conf["day"]
                      }
                      return dag_run_obj

                  trigger_step = TriggerDagRunOperator(
                      task_id="trigger_modelling",
                      trigger_dag_id="Dummy_Modelling",
                      provide_context=True,
                      python_callable=trigger,
                      dag=dag
                  )


                  It yields a warning regarding the use of provide_context:

                  INFO - Subtask: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/airflow/models.py:1927: PendingDeprecationWarning: Invalid arguments were passed to TriggerDagRunOperator. Support for passing such arguments will be dropped in Airflow 2.0. Invalid arguments were:
                  INFO - Subtask: *args: ()
                  INFO - Subtask: **kwargs: {'provide_context': True}
                  INFO - Subtask:   category=PendingDeprecationWarning


                  And this error suggesting I haven't passed the conf :

                  INFO - Subtask: Traceback (most recent call last):
                  INFO - Subtask:   File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/airflow/models.py", line 1374, in run
                  INFO - Subtask:     result = task_copy.execute(context=context)
                  INFO - Subtask:   File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/airflow/operators/dagrun_operator.py", line 64, in execute
                  INFO - Subtask:     dro = self.python_callable(context, dro)
                  INFO - Subtask:   File "/home/user/airflow/dags/dummy_responses.py", line 28, in trigger
                  INFO - Subtask:     "message": kwargs["dag_run"].conf["message"],
                  INFO - Subtask: KeyError: 'dag_run'


                  A second pattern that I've tried which also hasn't worked is using the params argument like so:

                  def trigger(context, dag_run_obj):
                      dag_run_obj.payload = {
                          "message": context['params']['message'],
                          "day": context['params']['day']
                      }
                      return dag_run_obj

                  trigger_step = TriggerDagRunOperator(
                      task_id="trigger_modelling",
                      trigger_dag_id="Dummy_Modelling",
                      python_callable=trigger,
                      params={
                          "message": "{{ dag_run.conf['message'] }}",
                          "day": "{{ dag_run.conf['day'] }}"
                      },
                      dag=dag
                  )


                  This pattern does not yield an error but instead passes the parameters through to the next dag as strings ie it doesn't evaluate the expressions.

                  How can I access the configuration variables in the TriggerDagRunOperator of the second dag?

                    Solved:

                    The dag_run object is stored in the context and so the configuration variables can be accessed in the python_callable of the TriggerDagRunOperator with this pattern:

                    def trigger(context, dag_run_obj):
                        dag_run_obj.payload = {
                            "message": context["dag_run"].conf["message"],
                            "day": context["dag_run"].conf["day"]
                        }
                        return dag_run_obj

                    trigger_step = TriggerDagRunOperator(
                        task_id="trigger_modelling",
                        trigger_dag_id="Dummy_Modelling",
                        python_callable=trigger,
                        dag=dag
                    )

                            How did you end up reading the passed parameters in the triggered DAG? I need to do the same, and while I can confirm the parameter I want to pass is part of the dag run object's payload, I can't seem to "read" it in the triggered DAG.

                            I could access the parameters in my triggered dag with "{{ dag_run.conf['message'] }}" and "{{ dag_run.conf['day'] }}" . This relies on the fields in the operator through which you are trying to read the parameters being template_fields. If the "{{ dag_run.conf['day'] }}" pattern doesn't work for you because the fields aren't template_fields, you will be able to extend the operator class which you are using to make those fields template_fields. Let me know if this doesn't make sense and I will include it in my answer.

                            Hmmm.. I generate a file in the first DAG, and then read the file and dynamically generate tasks based on the data in the file, in the triggered DAG. Currently, I have no good way of "sending" the filename to the DAG. I can make it part of the payload, but can't assign it to a variable in the triggered DAG. I had already tried the methods in the examples and the ones you've used too.

                            I programatically create the filename in the first DAG and then use the same logic in the triggered DAG to read it. It is dangerous and error-prone and all that, but till I can figure out a way to pass the filename to the triggered DAG, I have no option, it seems.

                            @efbbrown this solution is not working in Airflow v2.0.1; i'm getting this error: Invalid arguments were passed to TriggerDagRunOperator . Do you know how we could be passing context in TriggerDagRunOperator in Airflow version 2?

                    In Airflow2.0.x, the equivalent of @efbbrown's answer is:

                    from airflow.operators.trigger_dagrun import TriggerDagRunOperator

                    trigger_step = TriggerDagRunOperator(
                        task_id="trigger_modelling",
                        trigger_dag_id="Dummy_Modelling",
                        conf={"message": "{{ dag_run.conf['message'] }}", "day":"{{
                        dag_run.conf['day'] }}"},
                        dag=dag
                    )


                    The pull request is described here on GitHub.

                    See the documentation for external-triggers and for trigger_dagrun.

                    Here is a YouTube video on the topic that shows the correct imports.

                            Hi, Is it not possible to create the dag_run_obj payload or the conf parameter dynamically? When triggering the TriggerDagRunOperator? This used to be possible before the python_callable parameter was depreciated in Airflow 2.0.

                            @mathee, Yes, it appears that you can't do that using TriggerDagRunOperator. I solved that by adding an extra PythonOperator right before I called the TriggerDagRunOperator and I set up the dag_run_obj there

                    @efbbrown Yes either you can do that or whenever you access first dags params push it to xcom and pull it while triggering second dag
